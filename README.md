# foundations
in this series of exercises, we would practice different features of css:
1.css methods : -inline css.
                 -internal css.
                 -external css.
2.classes vs Ids selectors.
3.grouping selectors with same rules.
4.chaining selectors.
5.descendent combinator (only the p under the div will inherit the styles).
6.cascade fix (the css code order matters).
